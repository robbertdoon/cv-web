bugs to squash:

- if section is closed and browser is resized, section 'opens' without the state actually opening
  - workaround: open the state. ultimately, this needs to be revised

bugs squashed:

- showmore contentheight on resize: height does increase on smaller viewport, but does not decrease on bigger viewport
